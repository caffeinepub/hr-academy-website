# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Home page hero heading to display a styled “HR ACADEMY” title instead of “Welcome to HR Academy”.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the existing Home page hero H1 text “Welcome to HR Academy” with a two-part heading: “HR” and “ACADEMY”.
- Style “HR” in white and “ACADEMY” in red using the app’s existing red accent styling (e.g., `text-accent-red`).

**User-visible outcome:** On the Home page, the hero heading reads “HR ACADEMY” with “HR” in white and “ACADEMY” in red, and “Welcome to HR Academy” is no longer shown.
