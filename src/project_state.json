  "summary": "HR Academy is a full-stack Internet Computer (ICP) dapp consisting of a React single-page website (Home, Courses, Gallery, Contact, Admin) backed by a Motoko canister. The canister stores academy content (courses, gallery images, contact info), accepts public submissions (international inquiries and text reviews), and hosts a public gallery of admin-uploaded review screenshots. Administration is protected by Internet Identity authentication plus on-chain role-based access control (RBAC). Images are stored/served as ICP ExternalBlob values and rendered in the frontend via direct gateway URLs. The repository now also includes a reusable build-template (React + Motoko + shadcn/ui) plus image utility scripts to support repeatable builds/deploys and asset maintenance.",
