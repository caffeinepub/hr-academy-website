  "summary": "Header.tsx removes the separate \"Contact\" nav link and retains a single \"Contact Us\" button linking to /contact on both desktop and mobile. However, the header nav items now only include Home and Gallery, suggesting another navigation item (e.g., Courses) was removed, which conflicts with the acceptance criteria. Two metadata/state files were also modified without being requested.",

      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "No other header navigation items are removed or renamed while removing the duplicate \"Contact\" link (i.e., only the extra \"Contact\" option should be removed).",
      "reason": "The updated header navItems list contains only \"Home\" and \"Gallery\"; any previously existing header nav item(s) besides the duplicate \"Contact\" appear to have been removed, violating the AC that no other header navigation items are removed or renamed.",
