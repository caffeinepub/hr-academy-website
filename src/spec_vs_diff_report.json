  "summary": "REQ-10/11/12/13 appear implemented in the frontend (hero text styling, removal of Courses CTAs/links, header nav item removed, footer ‘ACADEMY’ text removed via logo-only BrandLogo). REQ-14 likely implemented (public submitted reviews query + submit invalidation present), but the actual on-page rendering of the submitted reviews list is truncated in the provided diff excerpt. REQ-15 cannot be fully verified from the diff summary because the backend delete API + admin-gating behavior is not shown in the truncated backend file, and the admin delete control UI is not visible in the truncated AdminPage excerpt (though described in the file summaries). Several unrelated styling/asset/provider and Courses page changes appear in the diff summary and were not requested.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Add an admin-only backend API to delete any submitted text review by ID, and add corresponding admin UI controls in the Admin Reviews tab to delete submitted reviews.",
      "reason": "The frontend includes hooks calling `actor.deleteReview(id)` and admin queries, but the backend implementation of `deleteReview` and the required admin-gating (rejecting non-admin callers) is not present in the provided truncated backend diff excerpt; the admin UI delete control is also not visible in the truncated AdminPage excerpt, so full REQ-15 acceptance criteria cannot be confirmed from the diff summary alone.",
